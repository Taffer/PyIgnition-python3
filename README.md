# PyIgnition-python3

A quick and dirty port of [PyIgnition](https://launchpad.net/pyignition) to
Python 3. See also it's Pygame
[project page](https://www.pygame.org/project/1527).

PyIgnition is a fantastic particle library for
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), written by David Barker and released
under the [GNU GPL v3](LICENSE) license. Literally all I've done is run it
through `2to3.py` and clean up any warnings pointed out by `flake8`, so
please refer all bug reports, feature requests, etc. to the
[PyIgnition](https://launchpad.net/pyignition) page on Launchpad. Note that it
doesn't seem to have been touched since 2010 though.
